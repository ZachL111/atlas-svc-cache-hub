# atlas-svc-cache-hub

`atlas-svc-cache-hub` is a Kotlin project for Backend services. It turns design a Kotlin verification harness for cache systems, covering policy evaluation, deny and allow fixtures, and failure-oriented tests into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Atlas Svc Cache Hub

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## What It Does

- Includes extended examples for queue pressure, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents bounded workers tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Purpose

This project keeps the domain idea close to the tests. That makes it useful as a reference implementation, a small experiment, or a starting point for a more specialized tool.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Design Sketch

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The Kotlin version keeps data classes and model logic close together for a JVM-friendly core.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Fixture Notes

`surge` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `accept` path with a score of 212. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at -21 and `surge` at 212, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Limits

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Next Directions

- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add one more backend services fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Setup

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.
